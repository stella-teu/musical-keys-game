# Musical Keys
Musical Keys is a rhythm-based memory game inspired by Simon Says. The goal is to correctly repeat an increasingly complex sequence of keys to earn points and unlock higher difficulty levels. Can you keep up with the beat?

This game challenges your memory and reflexes. The program will display a sequence of buttons that the player must correctly repeat using the arrow keys.

In **Standard Mode**, the player wins after correctly copying a sequence of 10 steps.
In **Infinite Mode**, the player can keep going to set a high score.
**Hard Mode** adds four additional keys (Q, W, A, S) to increase the challenge.
Players can combine Hard Mode and Infinite Mode for the ultimate test!
Oh — and there's a dancing monkey to cheer you on. 🐒
